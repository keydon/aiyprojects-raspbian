"""Run a recognizer using the Google Assistant Library.

The Google Assistant Library has direct access to the audio API, so this Python
code doesn't need to record audio. Hot word detection "OK, Google" is supported.

The Google Assistant Library can be installed with:
    env/bin/pip install google-assistant-library==0.0.2

It is available for Raspberry Pi 2/3 only; Pi Zero is not supported.
